# Welding-error-prediction
This is an ML model using an unbalanced dataset which included information regarding the ambient temperature, welding travel speed, etc. Since it is an unbalanced dataset, we had to use several pre processing steps such as SMOTE analysis and ensemble methods to arrive at the optimum model.
